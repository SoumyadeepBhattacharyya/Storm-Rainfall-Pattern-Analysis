# Storm-Rainfall-Pattern-Analysis
This project, “Rainfall Pattern Analysis ”, was conducted using both SQL and Microsoft Excel to study rainfall trends across different Indian states and districts.
First, the dataset was cleaned and imported into MySQL, where several descriptive SQL queries were executed — including total rainfall by state, average rainfall per district, rainfall category distribution, and monthly rainfall trends. These queries helped in understanding the geographical and temporal patterns of rainfall across India.
Afterwards, the cleaned data was imported into Excel for visualization. Using Pivot Tables and Charts, multiple dashboards were created to display:
                  
                      1. State-wise Total Rainfall (Bar Chart)
                      2. Average Rainfall per District (Horizontal Bar Chart)
                      3. Rainfall Category Distribution (Pie Chart)
                      4. Rainfall Over Time (Line Chart)
                      5. State Map Visualization (Filled Map)

Interactive Slicers were added for Month, State, and District to make the dashboard dynamic and user-friendly.

This combined SQL and Excel approach provided a complete end-to-end data analysis workflow — from data cleaning and query-based insights to interactive visualization, helping identify rainfall trends, heavy storm zones, and seasonal rainfall behavior across India.
